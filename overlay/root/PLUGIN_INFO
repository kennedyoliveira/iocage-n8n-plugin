n8n installed.

The default configuration uses sqlite database and it's suited for experimentation
and small projects, if you need to scale the application replace the database
for something more robust like postgres or mysql, check https://docs.n8n.io/reference/data/database.html
for more information.

The configuration file is in /home/n8n/config/n8n-config.json.

The application uses pm2 for daemonizing it, it has a utility pm2_n8n that you
should use instead of the regular pm2 cli for managing the service, examples:

Check logs

pm2_n8n logs


Restart the application

pm2_n8n restart n8n
